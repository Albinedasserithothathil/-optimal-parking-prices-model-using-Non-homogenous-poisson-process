#  Dynamic Parking Pricing System Using Machine Learning  
*A smart pricing model that predicts optimal parking prices based on real-time conditions.*

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project builds an **intelligent parking price recommendation system** using machine learning.  
It predicts the **best parking price** at any moment by analyzing real-world conditions—similar to how ride-sharing apps adjust prices during peak hours.

The model learns demand patterns from historical data and captures randomness using **stochastic behavior**, resulting in adaptive and realistic price recommendations.

##  How It Works  
The system evaluates several factors that influence parking demand:

### 🔹 Time-based features  
- Hour of the day  
- Day of the week  
- Weekends vs weekdays  

### 🔹 Weather conditions  
- Sunny  
- Rainy  
- Cloudy/Normal  

### 🔹 Traffic levels  
- Light  
- Moderate  
- Heavy  

### 🔹 Special events  
- Concerts  
- Sports matches  
- Festivals  
- Public holidays  

### 🔹 Historical demand  
- Past occupancy levels  
- Seasonal trends  
- Random fluctuations (stochastic patterns)

Using a **Random Forest Regression model**, the system learns how these variables relate to parking demand and determines the **optimal pricing strategy** for different scenarios.

##  Features  
✔️ Predicts optimal parking prices in real-time  
✔️ Learns from historical parking data  
✔️ Models randomness using stochastic behavior  
✔️ Suitable for smart-city & commercial parking operations  
✔️ Easy-to-use interface for operators  
✔️ Saves trained model for future predictions  
✔️ No need to retrain from scratch every time

##  Applications  
This solution can be used in:

-  Smart city parking systems  
-  Shopping malls  
-  Event venues and stadiums  
-  Airports  
-  Train/metro stations  
-  Municipal street parking  

Operators input current conditions and instantly receive a recommended price that balances demand, fairness, and revenue.

##  Why This Project Matters  
Parking demand behaves in a **random but predictable** way.  
By using data-driven pricing, this system:

- Increases revenue for parking providers  
- Prevents overcrowding during high-demand periods  
- Ensures fair pricing for customers  
- Enhances efficiency in urban transportation  
- Supports modern smart-city infrastructure  

This project brings intelligent automation to a real-life urban challenge.
